# GA-GGD
The official code for GA-GGD, (GA-GGD: Improving semantic discriminability in graph contrastive learning via Generative Adversarial Network).


For node classification on small and medium scale datasets, you can directly use:
```
cd ./GA-GGD_NodeClassification
bash run_{dataset_name}
```


For node classification on Arxiv or Products, first you should unzip the ogb.zip in these directories, then:
```
bash run_{hidden_dim_num}
```
